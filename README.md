Contracts and Inheritance
-------------------------

Liskov Substitutability Principle (LSP)
  - Given a Base and Derived class, a program that works with the Base class should also work with the Derived class.

Specification-based testing
  - establish invariants (contracts) and assert that those invariants hold for *all* possible arbitrary sample data
